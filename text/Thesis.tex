I would like to thank everyone who helped me to produce this master thesis.
First, I would like to thank my promoter,
prof. dr. ir. Frank Piessens, for providing me with this opportunity.
Next, many thanks go out to my supervisors, M. Patrignani and R. Strackx for supporting me throughout the year.

Furthermore, I would like to thank my friends, classmates, and especially my girlfriend Elke Sekeris, with whom many moments of joy or frustration could be shared.
Finally, I would like to thank my family for the encouragement and moral support I was lucky to receive.

\begin{abstract}
Malware infects many new computers each day.
Some estimates suggest that up to 30\% of all computers are in fact infected.
This malware is transmitted by exploiting bugs in computer software.
In many cases, these bugs abused by the exploit originate from the disparity between the computing model presented by high-level source language and the effective module used by the low-level target language.

These bugs are not prevented by analysis of the source language, for example using formal software verification tools, because they are effectively `introduced' by the process of compilation from source language to target language.
Instead, they must be prevented by strengthening the compilation process in a way that reduces the power of low-level attackers to that of high-level attackers.
Compilers that achieve this provide `secure compilation'.

This work uses the notions of full abstraction and contextual equivalence to formalize the requirements for a secure compilation scheme, and shows how secure compilation can be achieved for MiniML, a subset of the ML language.
As a prerequisite however, the secure compilation scheme assumes that the result of compilation runs on an architecture that provides program counter based access control, called a protected module platform.

The source language for this secure compilation scheme, MiniML, is not object oriented. 
Instead it uses a module system with the powerful notion of a functor to provide modularization of code.
It targets the LLVM Intermediate Representation as a target language.
A formalization of this MiniML source language and the LLVM IR target language is presented, enabling a formalization of the secure compilation scheme to be given as well.
