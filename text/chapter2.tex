\chapter{Formal Specification}
\label{chap:formalspecification}
In this chapter the source language, \MiniML, and the target language, LLVM IR, will be formally specified. 

First the syntax of \MiniML\ within which a program can be defined will be introduced.
Next, the typing rules that a correct program must adhere to is shown.
Lastly, the operational semantics determine what a correct program must do once it runs.

\section{MiniML}
\subsection{Syntax}
\label{sec:ch2syntax}
First this section introduce the syntax of the \MiniML\ language, as seen in \myref{fig}{fig:CoreSyntax}, \myref{fig}{fig:ModuleSyntax} and \myref{fig}{fig:ProgramSyntax}.
Like ML, the \MiniML\ syntax is composed of three parts~\cite{Milner:1997:DSM:549659}: the \emph{Core} language, a \emph{Module} language, and the concept of a \emph{Program}. 
The three languages, \emph{Core}, \emph{Module} and \emph{Program} each have their corresponding valid \emph{expression}s.
The division between \emph{Core} and \emph{Module} mostly correlates to the concepts of `programming in the small' and `programming in the large'~\cite{Milner:1997:DSM:549659,DeRemer:1975:PLV:390016.808431} respectively.
This separation of programming in the large and programming in the small aims to help programmers to introduce the right degree of modularity in their software.

\subsubsection{Core language}
The \emph{Core} mainly consists of \emph{value expressions} \cmath{e}. 
These express the manipulation of values and execution of functions to implement small algorithms or control logic.
Every value expression \cmath{e} needs to have a corresponding type \cmath{\tau}, otherwise the expression is not \emph{sound}.
The \emph{Core} language syntax is shown in \myref{fig}{fig:CoreSyntax}.

\input{coresyntax}

\subsubsection{Module language}
The \emph{Module} language uses \emph{module expressions} \cmath{me} to specify how the small parts of \emph{Core} expressions can be `glued together' or \emph{composed} into larger, working programs.
Its syntax is shown in \myref{fig}{fig:ModuleSyntax}.

The \emph{Module} language brings encapsulation and namespaces to \MiniML.
The \emph{Module} language does this by introducing the concept of a \emph{structure}, as was informally explained in \myref{sec}{sec:MiniML}.
A structure is defined using a \lsttext{struct} expression, and bound to an identifier \cmath{StrId} using the \lsttext{structure} expression.
It consists of a body of definitions which is denoted in the syntax as $\overline{\mathit{\delta}}$, using the bar notation for lists\footnote{
The bar notation uses $\emptyset$ as the empty set and the comma (,) as the prepend operator.
For example: $\overline{\mathit{\delta}}$ could be the empty set $\emptyset$ or it could be $id = e:\tau, \overline{\delta}$.}.
In its body, a structure \cmath{StrId} can bind values \cmath{id} to a value expression \cmath{e}, or can define a new type \cmath{t}.

Just as types in the \emph{Core} language limit the number of valid or \emph{sound} value expressions, signatures restrict the number of well-typed module expressions.
Signatures are named and bound to their identifier using the \lsttext{signature} expression. 
They are defined using the \lsttext{sig} expression, and their body consists of abstract type definitions, type synonyms and value declarations.

A structure can be ascribed a signature using \emph{transparant} ($:$) or \emph{opaque} ($:>$) ascription.
\begin{description}
\item[Transparant ascription] Transparant ascription \cmath{StrId : SigId} lets the implementation of type definitions in the underlying structure \cmath{StrId} propagate through, while hiding from external view any values that were not declared in the signature \cmath{SigId}.
\item[Opaque ascription] Opaque ascription \cmath{StrId :> SigId} restricts the external view of the structure to the values and types declared inside the signature \cmath{SigId}.
If a type \cmath{t} is declared abstract in \cmath{SigId}, its implementation is not known to any code not local to the structure.
\end{description}

In order to obtain a more simple language to study, \MiniML\ signatures of restrict their declarations to a subset \cmath{T} of the \emph{Core} types \cmath{\tau}. 
The subset \cmath{T} contains only opaque types defined by structures, the int and function types.
As a result, any value that is accessible from outside the structure itself can only get parameters and return values of type \lsttext{int}, of an opaque type or of a function combination of those types.

This results in arrays \cmath{[\tau]} and pairs \cmath{\tau_{1} \times \tau_{2}} not being primitive types for module expressions.
Only within a structure can a value be treated as an array or pair, if the value is of an opaque type defined within the same structure with an implementation containing the array or pair type.

\input{modulesyntax}

\subsubsection{Program}
A \MiniML\ program consists of a set of \emph{Module expressions}.
%, denoted as \cmath{\overline{\mathit{me}}}. 
It is then concluded by a single naked value expression \cmath{e}, functioning as the main entry point of the program.
This description of a program allows us to first specify a set of signatures as well as a set of structures conforming to those signatures.
The syntax of a Program is shown in \myref{fig}{fig:ProgramSyntax}

\input{programsyntax}

%A signature $\Sigma$ is a module type and is represented by a list of \emph{declarations}. A declaration $\Delta$ specifies the type of an value identifier or the signature of a module identifier.
%\\[2ex] 
%A module can be seen as a special case of functors. A module specifies a signature and module body and is uniquely identified with an identifier $M_{i}$. The module body is represented as a list of definitions $\overline{d}$. A module $M_{i}$ with body $\overline{d}$ conforms to a signature $S_{i}$ if every identifier in $S_{i}$ has a definition in the module body, and its typing does not violate the one specified in the signature.
%\\[2ex]
%Functors $F_{i}$, presented as a generalization of modules, specify \todo{Is it always possible to specify the interface of a module? In our simple system, yes, There can be no problem with opaque types since we don't support them.} their own signature, $S_{i}$, as well as a set of signatures upon which it depends, $\overline{S_{n}}$. It then specifies a functor body in which those modules can be used. The functor can be given a set of modules that conform to the dependent signatures. We say the functor is applied to a set of modules. The result of this application behaves as a module that conforms to the interface $S_{i}$ that the functor specified for itself.

\subsection{Type system}
\label{sec:MLTypeSystem}
Having defined the syntax for \MiniML\ and its parts, this section formalizes the static semantics, also called its \emph{type system}.
As stated in \myref{sec}{sec:ch2syntax}, types and signatures restrict the world of possible programs to those that consist of \emph{sound} or \emph{well-typed} module and value expressions.
It is the type system that formalizes when exactly a module expression \cmath{me} is of the correct signature \cmath{SigId}, or a value expression \cmath{e} of the correct type \cmath{\tau}.

The \MiniML\ language type system is based on the Hindley-Milner type system~\cite{Hindley1969,Milner78atheory}.
While the Standard ML implementation provides type inference using the Damas-Milner type inference algorithm~\cite{Damas:1982:PTF:582153.582176}, the \MiniML\ language assumes type annotations are available, written by the programmer.
This is by no means a fundamental restriction, the \MiniML\ language does not deviate from ML enough to prohibit the use of type inference.

\subsubsection{Type judgements and Contexts}
The type system validates programs by checking that a program \cmath{P} consists solely of \emph{sound} or \emph{well-typed} module expressions \cmath{me} and value expressions \cmath{e}.
%This checking will be done using rules that describe when a single expression \cmath{e} or \cmath{me} is well-typed.
%Formally, the type checker will perform typing judgements
This checking is done using \emph{typing judgements} that state whether a single expression \cmath{e} or \cmath{me} is well-typed.
The typing judgement of an expression \cmath{e} is symbolized by: 
\[\vdash e:\tau\]

The well-typedness of an expression \cmath{e} however does not depend on the expression \cmath{e} in isolation.
Instead, parts of the program processed earlier by the type checker can have an influence on the well-typedness of the single expression \cmath{e}.
This dependence of an expression \cmath{e} on earlier expressions is formalized using the idea of a \emph{context} $\Gamma$~\cite{Pierce}. 

This context keeps track of the type assumptions as well as structure and signature definitions made earlier.
It stores the facts that the type system has already established to be true.
The structure of a context $Gamma$ is shown in \myref{fig}{fig:MiniMLContexts}.

To access the mappings from \cmath{StrId} or \cmath{SigId} to its signature, its definitions or its declarations, the context allows for projections. For example $\Gamma[\mathit{StrId}].\overline{d}$ will look up the mapping $(M_{i} \mapsto \lbrace \mathit{StrId},\overline{d}\rbrace)$ in $\Gamma$ and project this to the $\overline{d}$ specified in the mapping. A lookup will \emph{fail} if the identifier has no mapping in the context.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{align*}
\begin{aligned}
\text{Context }\\
\Gamma ::=\; &\emptyset     & \expl{(Empty context)}\\
&| \; (\mathit{id}:\sigma),\Gamma          & \expl{(identifier typed)}\\
&| \; (\mathit{StrId} \mapsto \lbrace \mathit{SigId},\overline{d}\rbrace), \Gamma 
                                           & \expl{(Structure definition)}\\
% &| \; (F_{i} \mapsto \lbrace \Sigma, \overline{\Sigma_{n}}, \overline{d} \rbrace), \Gamma \\
&| \; (\mathit{SigId} \mapsto \Sigma), \Gamma
                                           & \expl{(Signature definition)}
\end{aligned}
\end{align*}
\caption{Contexts in the MiniML type system.}
\label{fig:MiniMLContexts}
\end{figure}

With the addition of contexts, type judgements become relations between a context $\Gamma$ and expressions \cmath{me} or \cmath{e}, formalized as $\Gamma \vdash e:\tau$.
This states that an expression or other part of the syntax is well-typed within the specified context $\Gamma$.

When typing judgement of a structure and its definitions occurs, the type system returns a new typing context $\Gamma'$ to perform subsequent typing judgements.
In this resulting context, all subsequent expressions must be well-typed.

The $\Gamma \vdash \Diamond$ judgement is a statement of well-formedness of a context $\Gamma$. 
A context is well-formed if the keyset of the lookup table it represents conforms to the standard notion of a set, meaning every key is used only once.
This makes it invalid to rebind structures or signatures.

The possible typing judgements can be seen in \myref{fig}{fig:TypingJudgements}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{align*}
\text{ExpressionTyping } ::=\;&\Gamma \vdash e: \sigma \\
\text{ModuleTyping } ::= \; &\Gamma \vdash \mathit{me} \rightarrow \Gamma' \\
%\mathit{StrId}:\mathit{SigId} \rightarrow \Gamma' \\
%\text{DefinitionTyping } ::= \; &\Gamma \vdash d \rightarrow \Gamma' \\
%\text{DeclarationTyping } ::= \;&\Gamma \vdash \Delta \\
\text{Well-formedness } ::=\;&\Gamma \vdash \Diamond
\end{align*}
\caption{Typing judgements in the MiniML type system.}
\label{fig:TypingJudgements}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Type-schemes}
The typing judgements, in their contexts, do not type an expression using a type $\tau$. Instead they use an extension on the regular type $\tau$ called a type-scheme $\sigma$.
The concept of a type-scheme is shown in \myref{fig}{fig:MiniMLTypeSchemes}.
%First, the concept of a type-scheme is introduced, as shown in \myref{fig}{fig:MiniMLTypeSchemes}.

A type-scheme, sometimes called polytype, introduces polymorphism by making use of the type variable $\alpha$ in the definition of $\tau$, and quantifying it with the universal quantifier $\forall$.
This allows any concrete types $\tau$ to `match' to the type variable.
For example, the identity function \inlinecode{id} is typed $id:\forall \alpha. \alpha \rightarrow \alpha$, thereby introducing parametrized polymorphism which enables one to use the same \inlinecode{id} function everywhere regardless of the arguments type.

Note that the definition of a type-scheme assures that the resulting type-scheme is in \emph{prenex normal form}, i.e. a string of quantifiers concluded by a quantifier-free ending.

%\\[2ex]
%Our type system will also need to keep track of the type assumptions and the module, functor and signature definitions. This represents the notion of a \emph{context}. It is in this context that typing will happen. While type checking, the context is what the type checker uses to keep track of the facts it already knows.
%\\[2ex]
%To access mappings from these contexts, we will introduce projections. For example $\Gamma[M_{i}].\overline{d}$ will look up the mapping $(M_{i} \mapsto \lbrace S,\overline{d}\rbrace)$ in $\Gamma$ and project this to the $\overline{d}$ specified in the mapping. A lookup will \emph{fail} if the identifier has no mapping in the context.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{align*}
%\begin{aligned}
%\text{Context }\Gamma ::=\; &\emptyset \\
%&| \; (\mathit{id}:\sigma),\Gamma \\
%&| \; (\mathit{StrId} \mapsto \lbrace \mathit{SigId},\overline{d}\rbrace), \Gamma \\
%% &| \; (F_{i} \mapsto \lbrace \Sigma, \overline{\Sigma_{n}}, \overline{d} \rbrace), \Gamma \\
%&| \; (\mathit{SigId} \mapsto \Sigma), \Gamma

%\begin{aligned}

%\end{aligned}
\begin{aligned}
\text{Type-Scheme } \sigma \; ::= \; &\tau \\
&| \; \forall \alpha . \sigma
\end{aligned}
\end{align*}
\caption{Type-schemes in the MiniML type system.}
\label{fig:MiniMLTypeSchemes}
\end{figure}

The concept of a type-scheme provides a kind of polymorphism called let-polymorphism \cite{Pierce}.
Two type-schemes have a relation called \emph{specialization}/\emph{generalization} that details how two types can match, even if they are not exactly the same, i.e. how an expected type can be matched by several effective types.

\begin{description}
\item{Type-scheme specialization}
The specialization relation $\sigma_{1} \geq \sigma_{2}$ expresses that $\sigma_{2}$ is more specialised than $\sigma_{1}$. This means that the following rule holds:
% $\sigma_{2}$ can be expressed as $\forall \beta_{i}...\beta_{m}.\sigma_{2}'$ and $\sigma_{1}$ as $\forall \alpha_{1}...\forall \alpha_{n}.\sigma_{1}'$, $\sigma_{2}$ is more specialised than $\sigma_{1}$ iff $\sigma_{2}'=[\alpha_{i} \mapsto \sigma_{i}]\sigma_{1}'$ and $\beta_{i} \in free(\sigma_{1})$. In other words, 
%

\[
\tag{specialization}
\frac{\tau_{2}=[\alpha_{i} \mapsto \tau_{i}]\tau_{1} \longspace \beta_{i} \not\in\mathit{free(\alpha_{1}...\forall \alpha_{n}.\tau_{1})}}
{\forall\alpha_{1}...\forall\alpha_{n}.\tau_{1}\geq \forall \beta_{i}...\forall \beta_{m}\tau_{2}'}
\]

In other words, the quantifier-free ending of the more specialized type-scheme can be obtained by consistently replacing all quantified type variables $\alpha_{i}$ in the more general type-scheme by a type $\tau_{i}$, which can possibly contain type variables itself, resulting in the quantifier-free ending of the more specialized type-scheme. Furthermore, only variables that were not free in the more general type-scheme can be bound in the specialized type-scheme.

The first condition gives one the possibility to specify the type of a type variable. This second condition forbids one to \emph{rescope} a type variable in the process.

\item{Type-scheme generalization}
Type-scheme generalisation is the opposite process of type-scheme specialization. However, whereas specialization can be expressed independent of the context, whether or not one is allowed to generalize, is dependent on the context. Generalisation allows one to quantify an unquantified variable, as long as it does not appear unquantified in any type expression in the current context.
\end{description}

\[
\tag{generalization}
\frac{\Gamma \vdash e:\Sigma \longspace \alpha \not\in \mathit{free(\Gamma)}}{\Gamma \vdash e : \forall \alpha . \sigma}
\]

\subsubsection{Signature Matching}
\label{sec:StructuralTyping}
Just like set of valid value expressions \cmath{e} is restricted by the type system using types, the set of valid structure expressions is restricted using \emph{signature ascription}. As mentioned earlier, these ascriptions happen either \emph{transparant} or \emph{opaque}.
This subsection explains how a structure expression is restricted by a signature using the \emph{signature matching} relation.

Every structure expression has a corresponding \emph{principal signature}, symbolized by \cmath{PS(\overline{d})}, where \cmath{\overline{d}} is the body of the \lsttext{struct} expression.
The principal signature of a structure expression consists of all type specifications and all values with their corresponding types.

When a structure is ascribed a signature, its principal signature must \emph{match} with the ascribed signature.
In this matching, the principal signature is called the \emph{candidate}, while the ascribed signature is called the \emph{target}.
The signature matching relation is formalized using $\mathit{\Sigma_{target}}\succeq\mathit{\Sigma_{candidate}}$.

For a \emph{candidate} signature to match its \emph{target}, any value or type specification in the \emph{target} signature must have an equivalent specification in the \emph{candidate} signature.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For types, this means that for each type in the \emph{target}, there is a type in the \emph{candidate} with the same name.
If \emph{target} carries a definition for the type, \emph{candidate} must provide the same definition.
\item For values, this means that for each value in the \emph{target}, there exists a value with the same name in the \emph{candidate} whose type is at least as general as the corresponding type in the \emph{target}.
\end{enumerate}

These signature matching constraints allow the expression of a structure to have a principal signature that is more broad than its ascribed signature.
It can define more types or values, and provide existing values with more general types.
These types and values can be used locally within the structure, but not in non-local code.

\subsubsection{Type Rules}
Using the type judgements specified earlier, it is possible to create a set of rules that specify when an expression \cmath{e} or \cmath{me} is valid.
Some expressions are well-typed unconditionally and in any context, for example rule T-Num in the typing rules in \myref{fig}{fig:TypeRulesCore}.
Others are only typed correctly if for example a certain subexpression is correctly typed. In this case, the typing rule becomes of the form shown in rule T-App, where the typing judgement below the line is true iff. the typing judgement above the line is true as well.

The typing rules are divided in rules concerning the core language in \myref{fig}{fig:TypeRulesCore}, rules concerning the \emph{Module} language in \myref{fig}{fig:TypeRulesModule} and rules for the \emph{Program} language in \myref{fig}{fig:TypeRulesProgram}.

The operational semantics defines a module table T, and the evaluation relation, shown in \myref{fig}{fig:MiniMLOperationalSemanticEntitiesAndRelations}.
This module table contains mappings from the %, module and functor identifiers to their definition and and the evaluation relation. 
module identifiers to their definition. 

The module table T allows looking up the definition behind a certain identifier and accessing a certain part of it using projection. $T[M_{i}].\Sigma$ will give access to the $\Sigma$ in the definition of $M_{i}$. 

The evaluation relation allows the evaluation of an expression $e$ to a (simpler) expression $e'$, while potentially making a lookup in T.

In \myref{fig}{fig:MiniMLOperationalSemantics}, the evaluation rules of a \MiniML\ program are shown.
