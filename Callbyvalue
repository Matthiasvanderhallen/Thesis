Call-by-reference can be simulated in languages that use call-by-value and don't exactly support call-by-reference, by making use of references (objects that refer to other objects), such as pointers (objects representing the memory addresses of other objects). Languages such as C and ML use this technique. It is not a separate evaluation strategy – the language calls by value – but sometimes it is referred to as call-by-address (or pass-by-address). In an unsafe languages like C this may cause memory safety errors such as null pointer dereferences, and also may be confusing. In ML references are type- and memory- safe.
