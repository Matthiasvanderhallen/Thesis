% Information about getting the source files.
% This is in a separate file because it is included in both the
% main book and the installation guide

You can get all the source code for this book,
by network file transfer (FTP) from the
several sites.  In each case, you need only get the file
$$
\mbox{\tt pjlester-}n\mbox{\tt .}m\mbox{\tt .tar.Z}
$$
where $n\mbox{\tt .}m$ is the current version number of the book. There is always
only one such file, but the $n\mbox{\tt .}m$ may vary as we correct errors and
otherwise improve the material.  Once you have got the file, run the command
$$
\mbox{\tt zcat\ pjlester-}n\mbox{\tt .}m\mbox{\tt .tar.Z\ |\ tar\ xf\ -}
$$
and then read or print the \mbox{\tt README}\indexTT{README} file, and the DVI file \mbox{\tt installation.dvi}.
If you don't have \mbox{\tt zcat}\indexTT{zcat}, do the following instead:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mbox{\tt uncompress\ pjlester-}n\mbox{\tt .}m\mbox{\tt .tar.Z} \\
\mbox{\tt tar\ xf\ pjlester-}n\mbox{\tt .}m\mbox{\tt .tar}
\end{array}
$$

The sites where the sources are held are as follows.
